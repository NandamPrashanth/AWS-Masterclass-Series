## What is Cloud?
  **The cloud** is a network of remote servers that store your data and run applications, which you can access using the internet.  

  Instead of storing files or running software on your own computer, the cloud uses **remote servers** (usually in large data centers) to store, manage, and process data.  
  
  You can access your files and apps anytime, anywhere — as long as you have an internet connection.
  
### Example: 

- **Google Drive**: Store and access documents online.
- **YouTube**: Watch videos stored on Google's servers.
- **Instagram**: Your photos and videos are stored in the cloud, not just on your phone.

## Cloud Computing  
  **Cloud computing** is the use of internet-based services to store data, run software, and perform computing tasks without needing your own physical hardware.

  Cloud computing lets you **rent computing resources** (like storage, servers, or software) instead of buying and maintaining them yourself.  
  
  You only pay for what you use, and you can scale up or down easily.

### Example:

- **Gmail**: Access email through a browser, no need to install software.
- **Canva**: Design graphics online without downloading anything.
- **Netflix**: Stream movies and TV shows from the cloud.
- **Zoom**: Join meetings hosted on cloud infrastructure.
