# Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

## Definition
**SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle)** is a structured process that defines the steps to develop, test, and maintain high-quality software.

---

## Phases of SDLC

1. **Requirement Analysis**
   - Understand user needs.
   - **Example:** A Library System requires features like adding/removing books, issuing books, and tracking due dates.

2. **Planning**
   - Prepare timeline, resources, and cost estimation.

3. **Design**
   - Create architecture, database schema, and UI mockups.

4. **Development (Coding)**
   - Write actual program code.

5. **Testing**
   - Ensure the software works as expected and fix bugs.

6. **Deployment**
   - Release software to users.

7. **Maintenance**
   - Update and improve software after release.

---

## Example: Food Delivery App

- **Requirement Analysis** → Show restaurants, order food, payment, tracking.  
- **Planning** → 6 months, 5 developers, 2 testers.  
- **Design** → Login, Search, Cart, Payment screens. Database: Users, Orders.  
- **Development** → Code app using Java/Python.  
- **Testing** → Test order flow, payments.  
- **Deployment** → Release on Play Store.  
- **Maintenance** → Bug fixes, add new features (wallet, coupons).

# Waterfall Model

## Definition
The **Waterfall Model** is a linear and sequential software development model where each phase flows into the next, like a waterfall.

---

## History
- Introduced by **Dr. Winston W. Royce in 1970**.  
- One of the first SDLC models.  
- Adopted widely because of its simplicity and structured process.  
- However, it is less flexible compared to modern approaches like Agile.

---

## Phases of the Waterfall Model

1. **Requirement Analysis**
   - Gather all requirements before development begins.

2. **System Design**
   - Create architecture, database schema, and UI design.

3. **Implementation (Coding)**
   - Developers write the actual program.

4. **Testing**
   - Verify the software against requirements and fix defects.

5. **Deployment**
   - Release the software to end-users.

6. **Maintenance**
   - Provide updates and improvements after release.

---

## Example: School Attendance System

- **Requirement Analysis** → Teachers need to mark attendance and generate reports.  
- **System Design** → Database for students & attendance, UI screens for login and reports.  
- **Implementation** → Code the attendance module.  
- **Testing** → Verify correct attendance storage and report generation.  
- **Deployment** → Install system in school.  
- **Maintenance** → Add SMS alerts later.

# Agile Methodology

## Definition
**Agile** is an iterative and flexible software development methodology where projects are divided into small parts (sprints), and software is delivered incrementally with continuous feedback.

---

## History
- In the 1990s, software development needed a faster and more adaptable approach than Waterfall.  
- In **2001**, 17 experts created the **Agile Manifesto**, introducing Agile principles.  
- Agile is now the most widely used methodology in IT companies.

---

## Agile Principles (Key Ideas)
- Customer collaboration over contracts  
- Responding to change over following a strict plan  
- Delivering working software frequently  
- Individuals and teamwork over tools and processes  

---

## Agile Sprint Process
1. **Planning** – Select features for the sprint.  
2. **Design** – Prepare simple designs for chosen features.  
3. **Development** – Code the features.  
4. **Testing** – Test as soon as development is done.  
5. **Delivery** – Release working software to users.  
6. **Feedback & Review** – Collect customer feedback, then plan the next sprint.  

---

## Example: Online Shopping App
- **Sprint 1** → Login & Registration  
- **Sprint 2** → Product Search & Cart  
- **Sprint 3** → Payment Gateway  
- **Sprint 4** → Order Tracking  

With Agile, customers get working features **early and frequently**, instead of waiting for the entire project to finish.
